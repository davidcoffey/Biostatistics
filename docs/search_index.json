Probability distributions are generally divided into two classes. A discrete probability distribution applies to discrete random variables such as the probability of being alive or dead as in the binomial distribution or the probability of a given number of deaths occurring in a fixed time interval as in the Poisson distribution. A continuous probability distribution applies to continuous random variables such as the mesure of hematocrit on any given day. The most common continuous probability distribution is the normal or Gaussian distribution and is defined by the following probability-density fuction: \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}}(x-\\mu)^{2}}\\] where \\({x}\\) is a continuous random variable, \\({\\sigma^{2}}\\) is the variance, and \\({\\mu}\\) is the mean. Properties of the normal distribution include: The curve is symmetric about \\({\\mu}\\) The entire shape of the normal distribution is determined by the two paramateres \\({\\mu}\\) and \\({\\sigma^{2}}\\) The area under the curve between any two points \\({a}\\) and \\({b}\\) is equal to the proability that the random variable \\({x}\\) falls between \\({a}\\) and \\({b}\\) The area under the entire normal density function is always equal to 1 The probability that the random variable \\({x}\\) falls between ±1 standard deviation is approximately 68%, ±2 standard deviations is 95%, and ±2.5 standard deviations is 99%. # Calculate the probabilities of a normally distributed random variable library(ggplot2) p = dnorm(1:10, mean = 5, sd = 1) p [1] 1.338302e-04 4.431848e-03 5.399097e-02 2.419707e-01 3.989423e-01 [6] 2.419707e-01 5.399097e-02 4.431848e-03 1.338302e-04 1.486720e-06 ggplot(data.frame(Probability = p, x = 1:10), aes(x = x, y = Probability)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) "]
